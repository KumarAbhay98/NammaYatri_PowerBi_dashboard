# Nammayatri Data Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of data from the Nammayatri app using Power BI and SQL. The primary goal is to gain valuable insights into the app's usage, trips, and financial transactions.

## Dashboard Design

For this analysis, we have created a set of informative dashboards using a gradient of yellow and green as the background, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. Each dashboard is designed to present key insights in a structured and accessible manner.

### Dashboard 1: Trips Overview

- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Displays the count of total trips per city (assembly), including both successful and unsuccessful trips.
  
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Represents the total fare per city (assembly), giving an overview of revenue generated in different locations.
  
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the distribution of fares by payment method, indicating the percentage of each payment method used.
  
- **City Slicer**: A drop-down slicer that allows users to filter data by city, providing insights specific to the selected city.

### Driver Earnings

- **Stacked Column Chart**: Visualizes the top 5 drivers based on earnings, providing a clear comparison of their performance.
  
-  **Pie Chart**: Highlights the cities most frequently searched as destinations, helping identify popular travel destinations.

### Dashboard 2: Destination Insights
- **Donut Charts**:
  - "Top 10 Source Cities with % Successful Trips": Shows the top 10 cities of trip origination and the percentage of successful trips.
  - "Top 10 Destination Cities with % Successful Trips": Displays the top 10 cities of trip destinations and their success rate.
